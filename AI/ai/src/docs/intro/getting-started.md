# About This Site

We've written the survey specifically as a starting place for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence and are teasing apart what's real from what's hype.

We assume you are involved in creating, managing, or green lighting software and want to understand how AI can give your software super powers (as [Andrew Ng](http://andrewng.org) is fond of saying). We do **not** assume you have a computer science degree. The people we had in mind for this microsite include:
* A **software developer** trying to get a broad overview of the products and services available
* A **business analyst**, **product manager**, **marketing manager**, or **consultant** who has heard that machine learning could help improve the product he or she is responsible for but doesnâ€™t have the time to go through all the options
* A **data scientist** looking to broaden their toolkit from basic statistical techniques to the latest and greatest AI toolkits
* A **line of business leader** trying to figure out the right way for their organization to put intelligence into their team's software, processes, and culture

Along the way, we'll explore software that will help you understand if your customers are excited or disgusted by your products. We'll compare how the big public cloud providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft (and now NVIDIA) fare vs. startups in identifying what's in an image or picture. Then we'll fire up Google's TensorFlow and train a deep learning model that will give your iPhone the AI superpower of recognizing business cards.

For people who like linear tours, we've provided navigation links at the top and bottom of every page that guide from the first room to the end. Feel free to visit the table of contents to get to the exact topic you want to explore.

A big hat tip to our friend [Diego Doval](https://twitter.com/diegodoval?lang=en) who built the site, generated most of the code samples and drafted the text based on some very high level, hand-wavy guidance. As usual, he's exceeded expectations. Thanks, Diego.

A shout out also to contributors [Delip Rao](https://twitter.com/deliprao?lang=en) of Joostware, [Mark Palatucci](https://twitter.com/markpalatucci?lang=en) at Anki, and my partners [Sonal Chokshi](https://twitter.com/smc90?lang=en) and [Michael Wee](https://twitter.com/theweester?lang=en) at a16z.

Enjoy the journey. We're excited about the potential for artificial intelligence to make our software smarter and easier to use, and be a better [bicycle for our minds](https://youtu.be/ob_GX50Za6c?t=24).
